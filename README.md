# LCLS_L10010 
Analysis tools for the experiment LCLS_L10010 at LCLS (XPP). The experiment uses the split and delay to probe atomic scale dynamics in aqueous sollution with X-ray Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy (XSVS). 

This repo includes analysis scripts for:
* Photonisation using the droplet algorith ('small-data' package)
* Angular intergration for WAXS ('small-data' package)
* Calculating the speckle contrast for SAXS/WAXS XSVS
* Estimations of SNR, contrast and temperare rise
